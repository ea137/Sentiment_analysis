Overview: 
In this Jupyter Notebook you will :
**Learn how TfidfVectorizer works by designing a countVectorizer, TfidifTransformer, 
  and Normalization Classes from scratch
**Learn how to preprocess and tokenize text data (Using Porter Stemmer)
**Use TfidfVectorizer to vectorize the reviews
**Classify the reviews with logistic regression with a +93% accuracy.

At the end of the notebook, you will be able to write your review and see if it 
will be predicted to be a good or bad review !!

Dataset:
This dataset contains movie reviews along with their associated binary
sentiment polarity labels. It is intended to serve as a benchmark for
sentiment classification.

Files: 
**Sentiment Analysis.ipynb : jupyter notebook containing the analysis.
**when you extract the train and test compressed files you will find are two top level
directories test/ and train/ which both contain positive and negative reviews in pos/
and neg/ respectively. for your convenience you will find them both in zip, and tar.xz
formats.

Files produced when running the notebook:
**LR_model.sav : saved Logistic Regression model.
**training_x_y.feat : sparse matrices and their labels stored in a LIBSVM format (to learn more
about it, visit http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) the sparse matrices are the tfidf
values of the learned words.
**vocabulary.json : learnt words and their indices in the sparse matrix saved as a json file.
